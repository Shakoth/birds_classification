An educational project where I learn how to train and create convolutional neural networks with PyTorch.
Dataset used here was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species


Project consists of 2 jupyter notebooks. One for comparison of several neural networks, and one is for training of neural network for maximum performance.
